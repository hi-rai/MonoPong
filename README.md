# MonoPong
FPGA based single player game

Mono Pong is a variant of the original Pong game in which instead of moving in the two dimensional space, the ball moves in only one 
dimension (along a straight line) and both the paddles are controlled by a single player. If the player hits the ball with the paddle,
it bounces to the other side, increasing his score by one and instead if he missed, the game gets over.  

Our project consist of designing a Mono Pong game using Verilog HDL with the help of an FPGA for the implementation. The game would be 
single player controlled and will display the score of the user as he progresses. It has start and stop buttons to operate the game and 
two buttons for playing (acts as paddles for hitting the ball). The display on the game also shows the level as user progress through the 
game. With each increase in level the speed of the ball increases, making the game harder to play. The level itself increases by one 
everytime the user score increases by ten.
